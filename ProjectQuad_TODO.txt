* To check collision between player and map tiles implement "PossibleToMove(map, current position, destination(up, left, down, right))" and then use it in "if (key pressed && PossibleToMove()) move_in_according_direction;"
* Write 2 more versions of NET pathfinder: one that returns list of packed solving positions like so: [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3..](No Vector2i class), second that gonna return bunch of Monogame.Point which is, turns out, exact thing as Vector2i.(This one's will be build especially to use in monogame)
* Get Level to parse and render correct tiles
